## finish task

1. use the nonlocal prior for the $\beta$ 

2.We want to use non-local prior, we can use the following model: 

$$
p(\beta_{jk}) = \frac{1}{m^2+s^2} \beta_{jk}^2 \text{Normal}(\beta_{jk} | m, s)
$$

When we take the log of the $p(\beta_{jk})$, we can get:
$$
\ln(p(\beta_{jk})) =  - \ln(\beta_{jk}^2) - \frac{1}{2s^2}(\beta_{jk} - m)^2 +C
$$

the domain of $\ln(x)$ is $x > 0$, however $\beta_{jk}^2$ have high probability to be 0.
So I set :
when $|\beta_{jk}| < \epsilon$,
$$
\ln(p(\beta_{jk})) = - \ln(\epsilon) - \frac{1}{2s^2}(\beta_{jk} - m)^2 +C
$$

when $|\beta_{jk}| > \epsilon$,
$$
\ln(p(\beta_{jk})) =  - \ln(\beta_{jk}^2) - \frac{1}{2s^2}(\beta_{jk} - m)^2 +C
$$
$$
\arg\max_{z_j,\beta_j} \, p(\beta_j | y_j, w) =\arg\max_{z_j} -(a+\frac{N}{2}) \ln(b+ \frac{\sum_i^N(y_{ij} - \mu_{ij})^2}{2})  - \sum_k^K \kappa z_{jk} - (\sum_k^K \ln(p(\beta_{jk}))) 
$$

3. estimate the $z$ and $\beta$ simultaneously

4. evaluation of the model

Data : use the single cell RNA dataset gse165897 data to create the pseudo data. 

The gse165897 data can be divided into two parts, treatment-na誰ve and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Then I set $x_i = 0$ for treatment-na誰ve and $x_i = 1$ for post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We do the doconvolution based on the model contained $beta$, We can get the $z$ and $\beta$ for the whole data.

Use the $u$ compare the estimated result with the real data to evaluate the model.
the truth $u_{ijk}$ can be calculated by summing up the sc-seq RNA data of$k$ tpye cells in sample $i$.
the estimated $u_{ijk} = w_{ik} \cdot( 2^{z_{jk} + \beta_{jk} x_{i}}-1)$.

# Pending tasks:

1.fix the the setting of hyperparameter of s0 and d0

2.use NMSE to compare the porformance of the model with different prior

3.use the statistical way to change the hyperparameter of prior.

4.Then we can seperately run the convolution on the treatment-na誰ve and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy data to get $z_n$ for treatment-na誰ve and $z_p$ for post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 

We can compare the $\beta$ with $z_p - z_n$ to evaluate whether the model can estimate the $beta$ correctly.
