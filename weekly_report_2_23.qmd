The thing I have done:

1. I successfully run the code for CibersortX and Demixt deconvolution.

2. I successfully run the code for differential gene expression analysis (DGE) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA)

3. I look through and understanding the code for combat and use single cell-rna seq data to generate the simulated data.

The thing I need to do:

1. Run the code for analysis on primary and recurrent tumors

2. Look through and the code for cibersortx and demixt and understand them.
